Overview
========

This project probably isn't generally useful, but maybe I'm wrong.  Sometimes that happens.

Anyway, the purpose is to set up and maintain my Ruby development environment.  E.g., setting up TextMate bundles can be something of a pain in the neck, so I use update-textmate-bundles.sh to take care of that for me.  I set it up as a cronjob and then don't have to worry about whether I have the latest version of a given bundle.


Tools
=====

* update-textmate-bundles.sh -- Updates a pre-defined list of TextMate bundles and installs them if they don't exist.
